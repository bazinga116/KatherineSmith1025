### Executive Summary 
The purpose of this lab is to practice working with folders and files and to survey the impact of the file/folder compression. This lab is also to define OOP paradigm and practice diagramming and creating software. 

### File Compression
The purpose of file compression is to reduce the size of a files data space. When one or more files are grouped together, it is easier to share and takes up much less room than the orginal file(s). A common compression file includes the Zip and GZip. 

The file size of my SVG graphic file is 57.6KB. 





### Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Conclusion
Throughout this lab I have learned to define OOP and practice putting into action aoftware. I also learned the impact of the file/folder compression along with practicing working with folders and files. THis lab tool a little bit longer for me to complete than other labs but, I learned a lot from it. I'm excited to see what is next!
