### Executive Summary 
The purpose of this lab is to practice working with folders and files and to survey the impact of the file/folder compression. This lab is also to define OOP paradigm and practice diagramming and creating software. 

### File Compression
The purpose of file compression is to reduce the size of a files data space. When one or more files are grouped together, it is easier to share and takes up much less room than the orginal file(s). A common compression file includes the Zip and GZip. 

The file size of my SVG graphic file is 57.6KB. The file size of my SVG graphic in a compressed file in windows is 20.9KB. THe difference in file size is the compressed file folder holds a reduced amount of space compare to the regular file. What you might experience using a JPG is a smaller amount of storage. Jpg files are normally small but, vary depending on size. 

### Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
Shark class is a defining function using the def keyword and has two functions associated. The methods of shark include swimming and awesome. The purpose of a constructor is used to initialize the use of data. Using a constructor can be used to carry out any form of data.

A class is the building blockes to design objects and is defined by a keyword. An object is an extention of class. The class is defined by a keyword and the object is created from it. WHen a objects from a class is instantiated it is represented or symbolized. 

### Object Oriented Concepts 
If I was going through a drive through window at my favorite establishment(McDonalds LOL) the examples of class that I would order is the names of the items McChicken and Fries. The ecamples of objects from ym favorite establishment would be the actual items I had ordered. 

Mix and Match terms. Object is sammy. Class is the shark. Encapsulation is swim(self). Inheritance is the specific type of shark. Abstraction is the definition of a shark. Why I matched each term how I did is because an object is the object, class is the attributes, encapsulation is the methods or actions, inheritance is what is transferrred to each shark, adn abstraction is the process. 

### Conclusion
Throughout this lab I have learned to define OOP and practice putting into action aoftware. I also learned the impact of the file/folder compression along with practicing working with folders and files. THis lab tool a little bit longer for me to complete than other labs but, I learned a lot from it. I'm excited to see what is next!
