### Executive Summary
The purpose for this lab is the recognize key ethical and legal implications of information systems. This lab is to also describle various database models and practice querying a database with SQL. 

### Data, Information, and Knowledge

#### Relational Data

Data can be defined as the exact facts of context or intent. Information is progressed data that witholds relevance and importance. Knowledge is the human perceptions about facts and/or concepts releveant to a certain context. 

The primary key in customers and orders table would be the table numbers. The customers and orders table would be related by the table that each customer is located and the order that each customer had. The foreign key in the customers and orders table would be the price on the reciept. It is important to properly define the data type of a field is because it decides what different kinds of data the field can store. 

#### Big Data
The four "Vs" of big data include the volume, velocity, variety, and veracity. Volume is the amount fo data and is the main characteristic that makes big data big. Velocity is the motion of data. Variety is the different type of data and data assets. Veracity is the earnestness of data. 

### Structured Query Language(SQL)
RDBMS is the Realational Database Management System. RDBMS relates to SQL by providing its foundation. The purpose of SQL is to gain permission and mainpulate databases. 

The two related tables I have chosen is the products and suppliers tables. The primary keys in each table correspond with each identity document. The relationship between the product and the supplier is the product is recieved from the supplier. The supplier is what creates every single product. 

### SQL Injections
SQL injections are a security threat because it is a technique that is used to destroy databases and is usually unnoticeable. Something that can be done to reduce the issue is to use SQL parameters. 
### Ethical and Legal Implications

#### Code of Ethics 
The "code of ethics" is a inscription that outlines a set of acceptable behaviors for a specific group. Association for Computing Machinery created a code for computing discipline because it clarifies an admissible standard of behavior for an experienced group. The code of ethics is an inscription that outlines a set of acceptable behaviors for a specific group. AUP is the acceptable use policy and it is a policy that outlines what is allowed/not-allowed while using a certain database. 

The site of my choice for further ressearch on acceptable use policy is github. The policy that I have chose is the user protections. It states that, "You must not engage in activity the significantly harms other users. We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting users as a whole".

#### Intellectual Property
WIPO is a world wide convocation  and their mission is to partake in the development of a balanced and effective international intellectual property system. Copyright is obtained when the creator of a work of literature or art has rights to it. The benefits with registering for a copyright with the US Copyright Office is the full all exclusive rights to a work. It might be important to copyright the svg image that I have created because it would protect others from copying my work.
 
#### Information Collection
COPPA restricts the collection of information on the internet because it is the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. It stops the collection of data for children under the age of 13. FERPA restricts the collection of information on the internet because it is the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. It stops the revealance of a childrens behavior or grades only to the student or parent. HIPPA restricts the collection of information on the internet becaus it is the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. It gives the parents rights to their child's information and controls who can see them.  

### Conclusion
Throughout this lab I have learned to recognize key ethical and legal implications of information systems. This lab is to also describle various database models and practice querying a database with SQL. I did run into one issue regarding the SQL coding submission but, after trial-and-error I completed the assignment. I have loved this course and have learned so much from it!
