### Executive Summary
The purpose of this assignment is to explore protocols that support one on one connections on the internet. Also, to put into detial internet programming methodologies and practice creating a web page with HTML and CSS. 

### Internet Architecture 

#### Internet Protocol

An IP address is the numbers that are appointed to a specific computer network interface. The importnace of an IP address is drastic because it is what stores and transports data. The difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is the length of numbers written for the IP address. IPv4 addresses are a variation of four nubmers separated by dots.
