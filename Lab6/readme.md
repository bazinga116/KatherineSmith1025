### Executive Summary
The purpose of this assignment is to explore protocols that support one on one connections on the internet. Also, to put into detial internet programming methodologies and practice creating a web page with HTML and CSS. 

### Internet Architecture 

#### Internet Protocol

An IP address is the numbers that are appointed to a specific computer network interface. The importnace of an IP address is drastic because it is what stores and transports data. The difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is the length of numbers written for the IP address. IPv4 addresses are a variation of four nubmers separated by dots. IPv4 addresses are composed of long strings of numbers (hexadecimals) that are separated by colons. 

ICANN is a non profit corporation with a goal of ensuring and bringing together global internet. How they contribute towards their goal is by connecting computers from arounf the world together to make a global internet along with the expansion onf the internet itself. 

#### TCP/IP

TCP/IP is the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. It is the protocol that interprets the details of how data is recieved and how it is sent. The client-server model applies to TCP/IP by the cient which is the computing device and the server that is what attends for connections. 

Layers are important to changing technology becuase if a layer or job needs to be changed in any way, it can be without affecting the other layers. The types of applications that run on the "application layer" is HTTP, FTP, and SNMP. 

#### Internet Security 


HTTP stans for the HyperText Transfer Protocol. The protocol that secures HTTP is primarily used for viewing internet web pages and uses clear text to store all of the information within it. A different type of HTTP is HTTPS which is a Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol. HTTPS includes a security feature and the protocol ecrypts data being entered by the HTTP. 

#### Securing your Web Browser
Securing your web browser is important because there is a threat of a software breach and revealing personal information in web browsers can becoma a way for attackers to compromise computer systems. One of the risks that are taken by not securing your web browser is the scripting in web pages can be used to evade systems. 

### Internet Programming 

#### World Wide Web Consortium
Tim Berners-Lee is credited for being the inventor of the World Wide Web. He created the World Wide Web Consortium to be a world wide community of people who work together to create web guidelines/standards. The standard of my choice is Web Design and Applications. This standard is important because it is what involves the guidelines to creating and 
providing web applications. 

#### HTML5 and CSS

#### HTML and XML 

### Components of a URL

### Conclusion
Throughout this assignment I learned how to explore protocols that support one on one connections on the internet. Also, to put into detial internet programming methodologies and practice creating a web page with HTML and CSS. I had a bit of an issue with the web page part of the assignment but, after a long time I figured it out on my own. I enjoyed this assignment and can't wait to see what is next.
