### Executive Summary 
Throughout this lab I will learn to identify networking components, topologies, and the role of NSA in networking security. I will also be able to define encryption technologies and approaches to cybersecurity to reduce threats. 

### Lucidchart
My experience creating the decision flowchart was very entertaining. To see a computer program in a flowchart makes code easier to comprehend. 

### Introduction to Networking

#### Data transmission
Each of the following terms are different variable in network communication. 
Packet- Unit of Data
Packet-switching- Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination
IP Address- Unique identifying number
DNS- Directory of IP addres common names
Protocol- Set of rules to allow devices to communicate

#### Networking Hardware
The benefit of a switch over a hub is that a switch can learn the physical  addresses of the devices connected to itt unlike the hub that detects a device. The benefit of a router over hubs and switches because the router moves/routes data from one network to another. 

#### Network Topologies 
A single point of failure is when in a topology has a single point that fails and gives into a cascading effect. The topology that experiences this issue is the star topology. Infrastructure topology is ver similar to the star topology but, this includes a wireless connection for wireless devices. Wireless mesh topology is when each computer on the network is connected to every other computer on the network through a wireless connection. In my opinion, I think the wireless mesh topology is best because it having so many connections, the probability of failure is almost none.
