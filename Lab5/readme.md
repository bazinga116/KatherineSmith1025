### Executive Summary 
Throughout this lab I will learn to identify networking components, topologies, and the role of NSA in networking security. I will also be able to define encryption technologies and approaches to cybersecurity to reduce threats. 

### Lucidchart
My experience creating the decision flowchart was very entertaining. To see a computer program in a flowchart makes code easier to comprehend. 

### Introduction to Networking

#### Data transmission
Each of the following terms are different variable in network communication. 
Packet- Unit of Data
Packet-switching- Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination
IP Address- Unique identifying number
DNS- Directory of IP addres common names
Protocol- Set of rules to allow devices to communicate

#### Networking Hardware
The benefit of a switch over a hub is that a switch can learn the physical  addresses of the devices connected to it unlike the hub that detects a device. The benefit of a router over hubs and switches because the router moves/routes data from one network to another. 

#### Network Topologies 
A single point of failure is when in a topology has a single point that fails and gives into a cascading effect. The topology that experiences this issue is the star topology. Infrastructure topology is very similar to the star topology but, this includes a wireless connection for wireless devices. Wireless mesh topology is when each computer on the network is connected to every other computer on the network through a wireless connection. In my opinion, I think the wireless mesh topology is best because it having so many connections, the probability of failure is almost none.  

#### Network Design
My network design was an example of Infrastructure Technology. It included multiple computers, a router, and a wireless access point. 

#### NSA/CSS
The NSA's role in the United States cybersecurity is to eliminate and prevent threats to security systems on a national level. 

### Cybersecurity and Encryption

#### Information Systems Security
If I was to be part of the Amazon.com online chat each component of the security triad impacts the job. Confidentiality is restricting access and protecting the customers personal information when given it. Integrity is giving the correct information about the customer at all times. Availability is being able to help the customer in a reasonable timeframe. 

Three daily tasks that require authentication is usernames and passwords to social media, the device used to access social media, and the fingerprint used to access the account(s). 

ACL is the Access Control List. The advantage of ACL is how simple it is to maintain and understand. The disadvantage of ACL is that you must manage each source of information separetly. RBAC is Role-Based Access Control. The advantage of RBAC is the fact that it is the more improved technique for access control. 

Cyphertext is what an individual would use to decrypt a message. The public key is what incodes a message. The private key is what decodes a message. Each of these components are needed to encrypt and decrypt a message. We need the public key cryptography because it is what gives authorization to data encrypted or decrypted. 

#### Cryptography
The message that I typed into "Caesar Cipher Exploration Box" is this is the secret message. What this encryption does is shifts the alphabet one to the right. For example, a is b, b is c, c is d, and etc. The encrypted message is uijt jt uif tfdsfu nfttbhf.

The message that I typed into "Frequency Fingerprint Exploration" is this is the secret message. What this encryption does is make a bar graph out of the amount of each letter that I used in the message. 

A polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher based off of a substitution of a variable. The message that I typed into "Polyalphabetic Exploration" is this is the secret message and a shift word as laugh. The result of the encryption is a combination of the amount of letters used in my message and the shift word. 

#### Brute-Force
Brute-force is a cipher that attempts all possible decryption keys. Brute-Force relates to Kerckhoff's principle by simply saying that the cipher should still be secure even if everything works in Brute-Force. 

### Conclusion
Throughout this lab I have learned to identify networking components, topologies, and the role of NSA in networking security. I have also been able to define encryption technologies and approaches to cybersecurity to reduce threats. I have not had any issues with this content but, I am exicted to see what is next!
