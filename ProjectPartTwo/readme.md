### Topic of Interest: Security 
The reason why I chose security as my topic of interest is because it is something important that I wanted to look more into. I have decided to implement a simple security code to see what measures can protect information vulnerabilities. Security was addressed a decent amount throughout this course but, I wanted to look more into how a security code works. The code that I have implemented is a code that will protect information using a security code. The code is under the code insert and the result of that code is under result. 

### Summary 
Throughout this project I have learned more about proper code security and how it works in action. My overall experience in this course was truly amazing. This is the first class for me that finally clicked. I have struggled in that past with courses but, this course I could throughly understand. This course has put into perspective that this is the career field and college program I want to succeed in. My next steps is to complete courses towards my major in IT programming and development and graduate with passing classes.
